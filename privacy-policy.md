Data Collection and Usage
The extension adds custom items to the right-click menu for selected text, links and pages. These items let the user send an IOC (IP, domain, URL or hash) to their chosen OSINT tools in one click. The contextMenus permission is required to create these entries and detect which one the user clicked. No additional data is collected; only the user’s current selection and the configured URLs are used.

Data Storage
The extension stores its configuration (categories, OSINT providers, and the “open in new window” setting) using chrome.storage. This is needed so the user’s custom analyzers and preferences persist across browser sessions and machines. All data is kept locally in the user’s browser profile and is never sent to any external server by the extension.

Data Sharing
There is no data that is sold or shared with third parties
It does not collect or transmit any personal information.

Data Security
Chrome encrypts local storage

Updates
This privacy policy may be revised from time to time. The extension will inform users of any big changes via update process.
